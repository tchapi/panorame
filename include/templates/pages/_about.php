  <h3>Vision</h3>

  <p>Panorame redefines the 'search-for-a-place-to-go' experience.</p>

  <p>You were crawling long webpages of recommended places, shortlisting a few ones, and then checking for each one how to 	get there and if it's not too far from home? That's really not the experience the web should offer you.</p>

  <p>Our research shows that 94% of users are regularly irritated by the
  classical 'search-for-a-place' experience on the web.</p>

  <p>What if the area easily reachable around your home mattered first.
  What if you were intuitively and dynamically configuring this area, visualizing it.
  What if the recommended places came only then, localized in your personalized area, your playzone.</p>

  <p>What if, from the very beginning, we took into consideration that you were willing to move not farther than 10min by 	         foot from home? Or maybe by bike today. And why not tomorrow with combining walking and
taking the tube.</p>

  <p>With Panorame you first define your start location (home is a good choice!), choose your transportation mean, and decide how long you are willing to invest in the journey. Here comes your playzone: you just
defined it, and it is there, on your screen. Of course you can refine your parameters, your playzone is totally dynamic and will update instantly.
Then only come the landmarks recommendations, in the area covered by your zone of course.</p>
